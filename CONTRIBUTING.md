## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates. When creating a bug report, please include:

- A clear and descriptive title
- Exact steps to reproduce the problem
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior
- Code samples or test cases that demonstrate the issue
- Your environment details (OS, Java version, etc.)

Use the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) when creating issues.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please include:

- A clear and descriptive title
- A detailed description of the proposed functionality
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful
- List any alternative solutions you've considered

Use the [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) when creating feature requests.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues labeled:

- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention needed
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements

### Pull Requests

1. Ensure your code follows the project's code style
2. Update documentation as needed
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Ensure all tests pass locally
5. Update the README.md if needed
6. Fill out the pull request template completely

## Development Process

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Install required dependencies:
   - JDK 17+
   - PostgreSQL 14+
   - Redis 7+

2. Set up environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   cp setup-database.sql.example setup-database.sql
   # Edit files with your configuration
   ```

3. Run database setup:
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres < setup-database.sql
   ./gradlew flywayMigrate
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```

### Project Structure

```
src/main/kotlin/com/musify/
â”œâ”€â”€ domain/         # Business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ data/          # Data layer
â”œâ”€â”€ presentation/  # API layer
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/# External services
â””â”€â”€ di/           # Dependency injection
```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Maintain test coverage above 70%
- Use descriptive test names

Example test:
```kotlin
@Test
fun `should return 401 when accessing protected endpoint without token`() {
    // Test implementation
}
```

## Style Guidelines

### Kotlin Style

We follow the official [Kotlin Coding Conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html) with these additions:

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use data classes for DTOs
- Prefer immutability
- Use coroutines for async operations

### Code Formatting

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Add blank lines between class members
- Group related functionality together

Run Ktlint to check formatting:
```bash
./gradlew ktlintCheck
```

### Documentation

- Add KDoc comments to all public APIs
- Document complex algorithms
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Write clear commit messages

## Commit Guidelines

## API Design Guidelines

When adding new endpoints:

1. Follow RESTful conventions
2. Use appropriate HTTP methods
3. Return consistent response formats
4. Include proper error handling
5. Document the endpoint in code

Example:
```kotlin
/**
 * Get user playlists
 * @return List of user's playlists
 */
get("/api/playlists") {
    // Implementation
}
```

## Database Changes

When making database changes:

1. Create a new migration file:
   ```
   V{number}__{description}.sql
   ```

2. Test migration locally:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew flywayMigrate
   ```

3. Include rollback strategy in PR description
