## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

1. **Set Production Environment**
   ```bash
   export ENVIRONMENT=production
   export JWT_SECRET=<generate-secure-secret>
   export DATABASE_URL=<production-database-url>
   ```

2. **Run Database Migrations**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew flywayMigrate
   ```

3. **Create Initial Admin**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/create-admin-production.sh
   ```

4. **Enable Security Features**
   - Set strong JWT secret
   - Enable HTTPS only
   - Configure firewall rules
   - Set up DDoS protection

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit sensitive data**
   - Use environment variables
   - Use secrets management service
   - Rotate credentials regularly

2. **Implement rate limiting**
   - Login attempts
   - API calls per user
   - Password reset requests

3. **Monitor everything**
   - Failed logins
   - Unusual activity patterns
   - Database queries
   - API response times

4. **Regular updates**
   - Security patches
   - Dependency updates
   - Database backups
   - Penetration testing
